# 🎨 Seina Gallery  

As part of my web development training, I designed and developed an online art gallery for an independent artist, focusing on user experience, frontend efficiency, and integration with payment systems for purchasing artwork.

My primary focus was usability and accessibility, ensuring that any visitor could navigate and explore the artwork seamlessly. The user interface is optimized to provide an immersive experience, highlighting the artistic work and facilitating the conversion of visitors into buyers.

To enable online transactions, I integrated a payment API that allows users to purchase artwork easily and securely. This not only optimizes sales conversion but also builds customer trust by offering secure and well-recognized payment methods.
