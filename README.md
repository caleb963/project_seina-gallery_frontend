# 🎨 Seina Gallery  

As part of my web development training, I designed and developed an online art gallery for an independent artist, focusing on user experience, frontend efficiency, and integration with payment systems for purchasing artwork.

My primary focus was usability and accessibility, ensuring that any visitor could navigate and explore the artwork seamlessly. The user interface is optimized to provide an immersive experience, highlighting the artistic work and facilitating the conversion of visitors into buyers.

To enable online transactions, I integrated a payment API that allows users to purchase artwork easily and securely. This not only optimizes sales conversion but also builds customer trust by offering secure and well-recognized payment methods.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Modern & Responsive UI:** Built with **React.js**, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.  
- **Artwork Showcase:** Dynamic display of featured artwork with high-quality images and detailed descriptions.  
- **Shopping Cart & Secure Checkout:** Full e-commerce functionality, allowing users to add items to their cart and complete purchases.  
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system using **JWT authentication**.  
- **PayPal Payment Integration:** Seamless and secure transactions using the **PayPal API**.  
- **Admin Panel:** Backend system for managing artworks, orders, and customer interactions.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
### **Frontend**  
- **React.js** → Interactive and component-based UI.  
- **CSS Modules** → Modular and reusable styling for better scalability.  
- **Vite** → Optimized development and fast build process.  

### **Backend**  
- **Node.js + Express.js** → Server-side development and API management.  
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** → Database for handling artwork, users, and transactions.
